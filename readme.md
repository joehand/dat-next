#### What is all Dat?

The Dat project is a set of open source applications for sharing data or files led by [Code for Science & Society](http://codeforscience.org), a grant funded non-profit, and built on the [Dat Protocol](https://www.datprotocol.com/).
With Dat applications you can share files with collaborators, back up data to servers, and automate long-term data preservation.
The Decentralized Archive Transport (Dat) protocol transfers files in a **secure**, **distributed**, and **fast** network allowing you to focus on the fun work without worrying about moving files around.

* **Secure** - Dat data transfer is encrypted and the content verified on arrival. Changes are written to an append-only log ensuring transparency of updates. [Check out our security and privacy FAQ](#TODO).
* **Distributed** - With the Dat protocol you'll connect directly to other users or servers sharing or downloading common datasets. Any device can host files to share without the need for centralized servers. [Read about the distrbuted web and Dat](#TODO).
* **Fast** - Files download from multiple sources. Quickly sync updates by only downloading the new bytes, saving time and bandwidth. [Learn about how the Dat project makes file transfers fast](#TODO).

### Key features:

* **Share files** to colleagues, servers, or long-term archives.
* **Automatically update** changes by sharing new files and syncing with the network.
* **Distribute large datasets** without copying data to a central server by connecting directly to peers.
* **Version history data** by tracking all changes in metadata and easily backing up old versions of files on large storage servers.
* **Persistent identification** of changing datasets with a unique link.
* **Instantly host** files through the distributed network and unique identifier.

## Getting Started

The Dat command line tool can be installed with `npm`. Make sure you have `node` version 4 or above and `npm` installed.
You can run `node -v` and `npm -v` to check!

Need to install Node? [Start here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

### Installing Dat

Install `dat` from npm with the `--global, -g` option:

```
npm install -g dat
```

You should be able to run the `dat` command now. If not, see the [installation troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) for tips.

### Quickstart

We have Dat installed, let's use it! Currently, the Dat command line always moves files from a single source to any number of destinations.
If you are creating files on your computer to share, you will be the source and will use the *share* commands.
Otherwise, you can *clone* files from remote Dat archives shared to you with a Dat link.

You can mostly get around in the Dat command line world with two commands:

#### `dat share <dir>`

Use `dat share` to send files from your computer to any number of other computers or servers.
This will share a local `<dir>` and print a `dat://` link.
Send the printed link to other users so they can download your files.

Dat share will create a `.dat` directory in the folder you share.
The `.dat` folder allows you to add new files and update old files on the same Dat link. 

**Make sure not to share the `.dat` folder with anyone, it contains a private key that allows you to update and add files.**

##### TODO gif

#### `dat clone dat://<link> <download-dir>`

Use `dat clone` to download files from a remote computers sharing files with Dat.
This will download the files from `dat://<link>` to your `<download-dir>`.
The download exits after it completes but you can continue to update the files later after the clone is done.

#### A Brief Primer on `dat://`` links

> You may have seen Dat links around: `dat://ff34725120b2f3c5bd5028e4f61d14a45a22af48a7b12126d5d588becde88a93`. What is with the weird long string of characters? Let's break it down!

##### `dat://` - the protocol

The first part of the link is the link protocol, Dat (read about the Dat protocol at [datprotocol.com](http://www.datprotocol.com)).
The protocol describes what "language" the link is in and what type of applications can open it.

##### `ff34725120b2f3c5bd5028e4f61d14a45a22af48a7b12126d5d588becde88a93` - the unique identifier

The second part of the link is a 64-character hex strings ([ed25519 public-keys](https://ed25519.cr.yp.to/) to be precise).
Each Dat archive gets a public key link to identify it.
With the hex string as a link we can do two things: 1) encrypt the data transfer and 2) give each archive a persistent identifier, an ID that never changes, even as file are updated (as opposed to a checksum which is based on the file contents).

##### `dat://ff34725120b2f3c5bd5028e4f61d14a45a22af48a7b12126d5d588becde88a93`

All together, the links can be thought of similarly to a web URL, as a place to get content, but with some extra special properties.
Links point to a set of files instead of a specific server.
This means when you run `dat clone dat://<link>` you do not have to worry about who is hosting the files at that link or if the content has changed.
You'll always get the latest content in the network and the link helps to verify the integrity of the content!

Try out `dat clone` with the link above to read more about the protocol!

### Demo File Download

To get started using Dat, we can download files via Dat.
Similar to git, you do this by running `dat clone`:

```
dat clone dat://ff34725120b2f3c5bd5028e4f61d14a45a22af48a7b12126d5d588becde88a93 datprotocol-website

Cloning Dat Archive: /Users/joe/Desktop/datprotocol-website
Link: dat://ff34725120b2f3c5bd5028e4f61d14a45a22af48a7b12126d5d588becde88a93

Metadata: [==================================================>] 100%
Content:  [=====>---------------------------------------------] 11%
Total size: 8 files (43.3 kB)

2 peers on the Dat Network
Downloading: 2.68 kB/s 
```

This will download the files shared at that link to a folder named datprotocol-website.
These files are being shared by a server over Dat (to ensure high availability) but you may connect to any number of peers also hosting the content.

Get started using Dat today with the `share` and `clone` commands or read below for more details.

## Usage

Dat archives have a one to many relationship. There is a single source that can create and write files. There are many peers that can download the files *(in future versions there may be several sources)*.

* **Sharing**: If you want to share files from your computer that you will update, you are the *source*.
* **Downloading**: If your colleague has files they want to share, they will be the source and you'll be downloading from a *remote* archive.

The first time you run a command, a `.dat` folder to store the Dat metadata.
Once a Dat is created, you can run all the commands inside that folder, similar to git.

### Sharing

The quickest way to get started sharing files is to `share`:

```
> dat share

Syncing Dat Archive: /Users/joe/Desktop/datproject-website
Link: dat://b44a53f3dcad90349ba743e21fca4869cd3fb79d9f8b55a556af04e5ad49bb79

Archive update finished! Sharing latest files.
Total Size: 51 files (3.23 MB)

Looking for connections in Dat Network...
```

You can also do `create` and `sync` in separate steps if you'd like more control over the importing.

#### Creating a Dat archive

```
dat create [<folder>] [--import]
```

Create a new Dat Archive in the current directory (or specify `dir`).
Will automatically import the files in that directory to the archive.

* Use `--import` to import files after the archive is created.

#### Syncing to Network

```
dat sync [<folder>] [--no-import] [--no-watch]
```

Start sharing your Dat Archive over the network.
Sync will import new or updated files since you ran `create` or `sync` last.
Sync watched files for changes and imports updated files.

* Use `--no-import` to not import any new or updated files.
* Use `--no-watch` to not watch directory for changes. `--import` must be true for `--watch` to work.

#### Snapshot

A snapshot archive shares a folder with specific content. Content can only be added once and then the link is created. Once a snapshot archive has a link, it cannot be updated. 

```
dat snapshot [<folder>]
```

Snapshot will create the archive in snapshot, `{live: false}`, mode.


### Downloading

Start downloading by running the `clone` command. This will create a folder, download the content and metadata, and create a `.dat` folder. Once you started the download, you can resume using `clone` or the other download commands.

```
dat clone <dat-link> [<folder>] [--temp]
```

Clone a remote Dat Archive to a local folder.
This will create a folder with the key name is no folder is specified.

##### Options

`--temp`: Creates a temporary database and does not save the metadata to disk.

#### Updating Downloaded Archives

Once a Dat is clone, you can run either `dat pull` or `dat sync` in the folder to update the archive.

```
dat pull [<folder>]
```

Update a cloned Dat Archive to latest files and exit.

```
dat sync [<folder>]
```

Download latest files and keep connection open to continue updating as remote source is updated.

### Shortcut commands

* `dat <link> {dir}` will run `dat clone` for new dats or resume the exiting dat in `dir`
* `dat {dir}` is the same as running `dat sync {dir}`

### Dat Registry and Authentication

As part of our [Knight Foundation grant](https://datproject.org/blog/2016-02-01-announcing-publicbits), we are building a registry for Dat archives.
We will be running a Dat registry at datproject.org, but anyone will be able to create their own.
Once registered, you will be able to publish Dat archives from our registry.
Anyone can clone archives published to a registry without registration:

```
dat clone datproject.org/karissa/more-tweets-more-votes
```

#### Auth (experimental)

Other auth commands are still in an experimental status.
New registrations on the Dat archive registry are currently limited.

```
dat register
dat login
dat logout
dat whoami
```

Once you are logged in to a server. You can publish a Dat archive:

```
cd my-data
dat create
dat publish
```

All authentication requests take the `--server` option.
You can deploy your own compatible [registry server](https://github.com/datproject/datproject.org) if you'd rather use your own service.

### Upgrading from version 11

If you are familiar with the Dat CLI version 11, there will only be minor changes to use dat version 12.

To share files with Dat, you'll need to specify the `share` command now.

```
cd my-folder
dat share my-folder
```

After the Dat archive is created, you can run `dat sync` in the folder to share updates or use the same command as the old dat: `dat my-folder`.

To download files, you can use `dat clone` which will do the same thing as `dat <link>` did before:

```
dat clone dat://<link> download-folder
```

Once the initial download is complete, you can use `dat pull` inside to folder to update or use the same command as the old dat: `dat download-folder`.

## Troubleshooting

We've provided some troubleshooting tips based on issues users have seen.
Please [open an issue](https://github.com/datproject/dat/issues/new) or ask us in our [chat room](https://gitter.im/datproject/discussions) if you need help troubleshooting and it is not covered here.

If you have trouble sharing/downloading in a directory with a `.dat` folder, try deleting it and running the command again.

#### Check Your Dat Version

Knowing the version is really helpful if you run into any bugs, and will help us troubleshoot your issue.

Check your Dat version:

```
dat -v
```

You should see the Dat semantic version printed, e.g. 11.1.2.

### Installation Issues

#### Node & npm

To use the Dat command line tool you will need to have [node and npm installed](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node).
Make sure those are installed correctly before installing Dat.
You can check the version of each:

```
node -v
npm -v
```

#### Global Install

The `-g` option installs Dat globally allowing you to run it as a command.
Make sure you installed with that option.

* If you receive an `EACCES` error, read [this guide](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/fixing-npm-permissions) on fixing npm permissions.
* If you receive an `EACCES` error, you may also install dat with sudo: `sudo npm install -g dat`.
* Have other installation issues? Let us know, you can [open an issue](https://github.com/datproject/dat/issues/new) or ask us in our [chat room](https://gitter.im/datproject/discussions).

### Networking Issues

Networking capabilities vary widely with each computer, network, and configuration.
Whenever you run a Dat there are several steps to share or download files with peers:

1. Discovering Peers
2. Connecting to Peers
3. Sending & Receiving Data

With successful use, Dat will show `Connected to 1 peer` after connection.
If you never see a peer connected your network may be restricting discovery or connection.
Please try using the `dat --doctor` command (see below) between the two computers not connecting. This will help troubleshoot the networks.

* Dat may [have issues](https://github.com/datproject/dat/issues/503) connecting if you are using iptables.

#### Dat Doctor

We've included a tool to identify network issues with Dat, the Dat doctor.
The Dat doctor will run two tests:

1. Attempt to connect to a server running a Dat peer.
2. Attempt a direct connection between two peers. You will need to run the command on both the computers you are trying to share data between. 

Start the doctor by running:

```
dat doctor
```

For direct connection tests, the doctor will print out a command to run on the other computer, `dat doctor <64-character-string>`.
The doctor will run through the key steps in the process of sharing data between computers to help identify the issue.

## For Developers

Please see [guidelines on contributing](https://github.com/datproject/dat/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before submitting an issue or PR.

This command line library uses [dat-node](https://github.com/datproject/dat-node) to create and manage the archives and networking.
If you'd like to build your own Dat application that is compatible with this command line tool, we suggest using dat-node.

### Installing from source

Clone this repository and in a terminal inside of the folder you cloned run this command:

```
npm link
```

This should add a `dat` command line command to your PATH.
Now you can run the dat command to try it out.

The contribution guide also has more tips on our [development workflow](https://github.com/datproject/dat/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#development-workflow).

* `npm run test` to run tests
* `npm run auth-server` to run a local auth server for testing
